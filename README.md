## In this video, we'll be exploring the power of Telegram and Python by creating a Telegram bot that can respond with two custom keyboard inline buttons. These buttons will trigger specific functions when clicked. The project will be done using the Telegram Bot library for Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this video will provide you with a solid understanding of how to build a Telegram bot with inline buttons. 
Join me in this exciting journey of coding and let's build a functional bot together! 

## The Plan is to build a Eco-System around telegram bot which will automate most tasks or make them remote. This is a basic video on how we can use buttons and a previous code to make a social functionality the bot.
